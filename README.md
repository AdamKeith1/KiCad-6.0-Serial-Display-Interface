# KiCad-6.0-Serial-Display-Interface
Serial display configuration designed for STM32 SPI.

The follwong schematic was prototyped on a breadboard and the accompanying STM32 configuration code was flashed to the dev board (found on purdue ece 362 refs page).

Code for the video game configuration is available upon request but not displayed publicly to prevent current ECE 36200 students from using it as their own.
